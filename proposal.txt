Sharding your Rails Database	
At the end of this talk, you will know why and when you may want to shard the database your Rails application is using (Hint: never). If you decide you really do want to shard your database (seriously, don't), you'll learn how you can do it (with the db-charmer gem). You'll learn the difference between vertical and horizontal sharding. You'll hear about the the problems you'll face when you need to switch shards or query across shards. And you'll understand how sharding changes how you think about your app's data model going forward. Friends don't let friends shard without seeing this talk.
